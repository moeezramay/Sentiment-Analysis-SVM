## Performance Evolution

| Model/Improvement | Accuracy | Change |
|------------------|----------|---------|
| Initial Logistic Regression | 86.73% | Baseline |
| Basic SVM (LinearSVC) | 89.2% | +2.47% |
| Enhanced TF-IDF Features | 90.70% | +1.5% |
| **Final Optimized SVM** | **91.22%** | **+4.49%** |

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **BERT (Custom Training)** | **97.50%** | State-of-the-art performance, understands context, excellent for text | Requires GPU, longer training time |
| **SVM (LinearSVC)** | **91.22%** | Excellent for text data, handles high-dimensional features well | Requires feature scaling, slower training |
| **Random Forest** | **82.00%** | Good interpretability, handles non-linear patterns | Struggles with sparse text data, lower accuracy |
| **XGBoost** | **80.62%** | Fast training, good for structured data | Not optimal for sparse text features |
| **Naive Bayes** | **70.78%** | Simple, fast, good baseline | Limited by independence assumption |

### Why BERT Outperforms Traditional Methods:
- **Context Understanding**: BERT captures complex language patterns and context
- **Pre-trained Knowledge**: Leverages vast pre-trained language understanding

## Usage

### Option 1: SVM Model (Traditional ML - 91.22% Accuracy)
```bash
jupyter notebook sentiment.ipynb
```

### Option 2: BERT Model (Deep Learning - 97.50% Accuracy)
```bash
cd Sentiment-Analysis-SVM/BERT
python simple_bert.py
```
